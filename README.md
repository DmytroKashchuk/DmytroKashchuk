- **"Mind the CORS" (2023)** – IEEE-TPS 2023  
  *Authors: Matteo Golinelli, Elham Arshad, **Dmytro Kashchuk**, and Bruno Crispo*  
  Presented at: The 5th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent Systems and Applications (TPS-ISA). This study conducted a large-scale analysis of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations across the Tranco Top 50k websites, revealing security flaws in **29.4%** of them. The research highlights critical risks, including **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks**, emphasizing the real-world exploitability of these vulnerabilities.
